# DesignPatterns
1. Builder pattern - two examples to show its different usage. 
  -First by implementing internal/inner class - this solutions allow for more cleare declaration of constructor parameters -     look to class car.java. 
  - Second solution is using implementation of interface. This allow to use one class to make several objects with similar       features and call them by the same director class.
